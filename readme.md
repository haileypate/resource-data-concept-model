working through some options for describing local community resources in a flexible way. 

first goal is to start describing the entities, attributes, and relationships in a JSON schema. 

google worksheet for organizing is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K_XIwxAyY9HZxx46W7dsoG--C7C-jf3X58K1ut7P2uo/edit#gid=0).

JSON schema reference can be found at http://json-schema.org/.

## Why I'm doing this...
- A more flexible model is needed to help people organize their resource data
- Some people need spreadsheets, others need databases and APIs. We'll have a better chance of making those things interoperable if we have a common model to reference
- Civic technologists can start developing digital tools faster if they have a quicker way to learn about the info needs of this space

## Target model design features:
- machine readable documentation
- ability to receive and organize information from AIRS-compatible data systems with minimum info loss
- ability to take data in this schema and re-organize it for presentation using the existing data structures available at schema.org

## Target use cases:
- civic technologists use this model to better understand the information needs of help seekers and community resource data stewards... and that will help them build better tools to solve problems
- someone uses a simplified \(flatter\) version of this model to design a spreadsheet to help low-tech folks organize their data
- someone uses real-world data organized in this schema to inform the development of their database or API

## What the model is not: 
- the perfect way to organize a database
- written to be understood by entry-level technologists \(not today, anyway!\)
- validated
